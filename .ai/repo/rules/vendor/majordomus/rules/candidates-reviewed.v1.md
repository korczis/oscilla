title: Candidates are reviewed
description: A review queue that grows without bound is not reviewed. More candidates than the policy cap, a candidate that has waited longer than the policy age, or a candidate the tree does not track, is reported, not stopped; both numbers are declared once in the policy.

More records with status candidate than knowledge.candidates_max_files, a candidate whose review age exceeds knowledge.candidate_max_age_minutes, or a candidate under candidates/ that version control does not track, is a finding that names them; both numbers are declared once in the policy.

# Rationale

The deriver writes a candidate at every episode boundary that produced evidence, and nothing
removes one except a person promoting or rejecting it. Left alone, the directory grows, and
a queue that grows without bound is not a queue anybody reads. `project.accumulation-is-measured`
says that anything which grows on its own is measured and reported before it is a problem;
this rule is that measurement for the review queue.

Whether a candidate deserves promotion is a judgement, and a machine that emptied the queue
would be making it. So the rule is advisory: it names what has accumulated and stops nothing.
It is dispatched from `doctor` only, because under `watch` an advisory finding is drift and
the command exits 11, and a full review queue must not turn `watch` red in a hook.

Two of the three findings are about time and count, and the third is about visibility. A
candidate the tree does not track is discovered by nothing: the index does not see it, the
graph does not see it, no surface serves it, and a second checkout will never review it. It
is named so the person adds it beside the session record, which is what the deriver's own
output already asks for.

# Required behaviour

Candidates are reviewed, not accumulated. More records with `status: candidate` than
`knowledge.candidates_max_files`, a candidate whose review age exceeds
`knowledge.candidate_max_age_minutes`, or a candidate under `candidates/` that version control
does not track, is a finding that names them. Both numbers are declared once in the policy
and read by every surface; a superseded record stays under `candidates/` and counts toward
neither.

Review age is the age of the queue entry, not of the evidence. It is measured from the
oldest `knowledge.derived` line whose paths name the file, falling back to the commit that
added the file, and only then to the record's `date`; the finding says which source it used.
A record's `date` is the day of the evidence and is deterministic, so a candidate derived
today from last month's decision has been waiting since today.

# Failure behaviour

A violation is a `WARN` finding under the category `knowledge`, naming the paths (up to a
few, then the count) and which threshold or condition they crossed; the command continues
and exits as it otherwise would. The reproduce for the queue findings is `majordomus
knowledge candidates`; for an untracked candidate it is `git status --porcelain
.ai/repo/knowledge/candidates`, and the remedy follows `fix:` in the message: `git add
.ai/repo/knowledge/candidates && majordomus derive`. A policy that declares neither
`knowledge.candidates_max_files` nor `knowledge.candidate_max_age_minutes` is reported at
this rule's own class, naming the missing key, the way the retention caps are reported.

# Verification

`mj_validate_knowledge_accumulation` decides it, dispatched from `doctor`. The behavioural
case `test/cases/711_candidates_are_reviewed_not_accumulated.sh` proves it — the cap, the
age, the untracked file and the missing key are each a finding of the right level, and
`watch` is unaffected — and CI runs that case.
